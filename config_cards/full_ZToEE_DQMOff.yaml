### The different isolation selections to apply
Isos:
    # <label>: <selection>
    # label is the string inserted in histogram and plot names
    # cut is the value of the cut to apply.
    # For Non Iso, set the cut to -1.
    NonIso: -1
    Iso: 1
RecoToL1PtCutFactor: 1.25
probeToL1Offset: 10
### The different of regions of eta
Regions:
    # <label>: [<low bound>, <high bound>]
    # label is the string inserted in histogram and plot names
    # low bound is the lowest value of abs(eta) for that region (inclusive)
    # high bound is the highest value of abs(eta) for that region (exclusive)
    # EB: [0.0, 1.479]
    # EE: [1.479, 2.5]
    # EB_EE: [0.0, 2.5]
    EB: [0.0, 1.479]
    EE: [1.479, 2.5]
    EB_EE: [0.0, 2.5]
### The thresholds to draw the turn-on of
# Thresholds: [<thr 1>, <thr 2>, ...]
# thr # are the different threshold values (in GeV) to use
Thresholds: [34, 36, 38, 40, 42, 48, 50]

### These are some boolean fields to select to compute and draw some plots or not
#   these fields need to exist, and must be set to either true or false.
L1TEfficiency: true
L1TResolution: true

PU_plots:
    # Whether or not to compute the histograms for each bin of nvtx.
    # this field needs to exist, and must be set to either true or false.
    make_histos: false
